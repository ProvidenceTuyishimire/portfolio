                            <h4>High school certificate</h4>
<p>In high school I studied MCE(Mathematics Econonomics Computerscience)
in that time we study some basics about programming but we used two
languages such as c+ language and c++ language I have learned a lot 
about using that language we learned using condition like if,ifElse
and also I have learned loops for loop,switch statement.also we learned
operators
operators training related to programmingin order to continue learning and improving skill</p>

                            <h4>Diploma Degree</h4>
<p>when I finish high school,I went to study in University at Davis College
where I studied Information systems.I have learned a lot about programming
using different language used in programming.such as:HTML,CSS AND JAVASCRIPT.
also I learned java but we learned basic on how we can build mobile application
when I finish university I have attended some
training related to programming in order to continue learning and improving skill</p>

                            <h4>Front-End Developer</h4>
<p>when I was at university I did a project using HTML and Css because
I was heard that languages well that how I started to think that I can be
a frontend developer.when I finish University I started to attend many training
related to Front-End using different language used in programming.such as:HTML,CSS
AND JAVASCRIPT.when I finish university I have attended some training related to 
programming in order to continue learning and improving skill</p>

                            <h4>UI/UIX Design</h4>
<p>Because of loving FrontEnd and it is somehow combined somehow to design
I started learning different software related to design such as:figma,canvas
and I attended another traing to study about using designing they used three
software such as: Adobe photoshop adobe illustratorand adobe after effect also
we have looked about using figma how it works such as:HTML,CSS AND JAVASCRIPT.
when I finish university I have attended some training related to programming<br>
